        Over the course of human history, science has developed from our early
        understanding of fire, wind, water, and earth to exploring everything
        from galaxies far away to the very building blocks of life itself.

    <div class="paragraph2">
      <p>
        The aim of our museum is to create a space where everyone can experience
        the wonders of our discoveries and perhaps even ignite a lifelong
        passion to continue the exploration of the world around us.

        We believe science should not be confined to the textbook, but be
        brought to life through exhibits. This is why we have over 1000
        different exhibits on the many varied subjects of science to explore.
        <br />
        <br />
        Many of these exhibits are designed for you to interact with and play
        around to see science come to life

          >(apart from the dinosaur exhibits - they only come to life at night
          when everyone's gone home).</i
