          It is our pleasure to announce that Prof Sheila Widnall from the
          Massachusetts Institute of Technology will be delivering 3 lectures on
          the development of aeronautics and where the future lies in this
          exciting 'space'.

        <h4>Energetica Exhibition on Loan</h4>
        <p>
          On loan from the NEMO Science Museum in Amsterdam, the Energetica
          exhibition is coming to the Community Science Museum. It's a series of
          installations that allow visitors to experience the power of the
          elements as we harness them. From solar energy powering lighting, to
          'Wind Island' that shows how turbines are able to use and control wind
          to create power.

          Get your family together for an exciting night in the museum as you
          sleep over beside dinosaurs and science displays. Bring your own
          sleeping bag and get ready to rough it as we go exploring the wonders
          of science.

        <h4>Anatomy</h4>
        <p>
          The human brain at first appears to be without any functioning parts.
          Its seemingly uniform soft, grey mass remained more or less
          impenetrable for thousands of years. By the time of the Renaissance
          more brains were being dissected, often through efforts to uncover the
          seat of the soul. From the 17th century onwards a much more detailed
          anatomical picture was emerging, thanks in part to the ingenious use
          of ink injections into the blood vessel system of the brain.
